    <div style="height: 400px;">Kubernetes Pods are mortal. They are born and when they die, they are not resurrected. ReplicaSets in particular create and destroy Pods dynamically (e.g. when scaling out or in). While each Pod gets its own IP address, even those IP addresses cannot be relied upon to be stable over time. This leads to a problem: if some set of Pods (let’s call them backends) provides functionality to other Pods (let’s call them frontends) inside the Kubernetes cluster, how do those frontends find out and keep track of which backends are in that set?

Enter Services.

A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called a micro-service. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is (usually) determined by a Label Selector (see below for why you might want a Service without a selector).

As an example, consider an image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible - frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that or keep track of the list of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

For Kubernetes-native applications, Kubernetes offers a simple Endpoints API that is updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers a virtual-IP-based bridge to Services which redirects to the backend Pods.

        A Service in Kubernetes is a REST object, similar to a Pod. Like all of the REST objects, a Service definition can be POSTed to the apiserver to create a new instance. For example, suppose you have a set of Pods that each expose port 9376 and carry a label "app=MyApp".

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
This specification will create a new Service object named “my-service” which targets TCP port 9376 on any Pod with the "app=MyApp" label. This Service will also be assigned an IP address (sometimes called the “cluster IP”), which is used by the service proxies (see below). The Service’s selector will be evaluated continuously and the results will be POSTed to an Endpoints object also named “my-service”.

Note that a Service can map an incoming port to any targetPort. By default the targetPort will be set to the same value as the port field. Perhaps more interesting is that targetPort can be a string, referring to the name of a port in the backend Pods. The actual port number assigned to that name can be different in each backend Pod. This offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your Services. For example, you can change the port number that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.

Kubernetes Services support TCP, UDP and SCTP for protocols. The default is TCP.

        Services without selectors
Services generally abstract access to Kubernetes Pods, but they can also abstract other kinds of backends. For example:

You want to have an external database cluster in production, but in test you use your own databases.
You want to point your service to a service in another Namespace or on another cluster.
You are migrating your workload to Kubernetes and some of your backends run outside of Kubernetes.
In any of these scenarios you can define a service without a selector:

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
Because this service has no selector, the corresponding Endpoints object will not be created. You can manually map the service to your own specific endpoints:

kind: Endpoints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 1.2.3.4
    ports:
      - port: 9376
Note: The endpoint IPs may not be loopback (127.0.0.0/8), link-local (169.254.0.0/16), or link-local multicast (224.0.0.0/24). They cannot be the cluster IPs of other Kubernetes services either because the kube-proxy component doesn’t support virtual IPs as destination yet.
Accessing a Service without a selector works the same as if it had a selector. The traffic will be routed to endpoints defined by the user (1.2.3.4:9376 in this example).

An ExternalName service is a special case of service that does not have selectors and uses DNS names instead. For more information, see the ExternalName section later in this document

        Every node in a Kubernetes cluster runs a kube-proxy. kube-proxy is responsible for implementing a form of virtual IP for Services of type other than ExternalName.

In Kubernetes v1.0, Services are a “layer 4” (TCP/UDP over IP) construct, the proxy was purely in userspace. In Kubernetes v1.1, the Ingress API was added (beta) to represent “layer 7”(HTTP) services, iptables proxy was added too, and became the default operating mode since Kubernetes v1.2. In Kubernetes v1.8.0-beta.0, ipvs proxy was added.

Proxy-mode: userspace
In this mode, kube-proxy watches the Kubernetes master for the addition and removal of Service and Endpoints objects. For each Service it opens a port (randomly chosen) on the local node. Any connections to this “proxy port” will be proxied to one of the Service’s backend Pods (as reported in Endpoints). Which backend Pod to use is decided based on the SessionAffinity of the Service. Lastly, it installs iptables rules which capture traffic to the Service’s clusterIP (which is virtual) and Port and redirects that traffic to the proxy port which proxies the backend Pod. By default, the choice of backend is round robin.
